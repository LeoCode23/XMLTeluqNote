Local files from the same directory and subdirectories were historically treated as being from the same origin. This meant that a file and all its resources could be loaded from a local directory or subdirectory during testing, without triggering a CORS error.

Unfortunately this had security implications, as noted in this advisory: CVE-2019-11730. Many browsers, including Firefox and Chrome, now treat all local files as having opaque origins (by default). As a result, loading a local file with included local resources will now result in CORS errors.
