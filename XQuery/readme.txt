5. saxonc-userdoc
-----------------
Provided as a zip. Unzip to access the SaxonC documentation in directory
saxonc-userdoc/documentation11.

Like the main Saxon documentation in source-userdoc below, the SaxonC documentation supplied in this
resources download runs as an interactive application driven by SaxonJS in the browser, which
requires use of a localhost web-server.

6. source-userdoc
-----------------
Provided as a zip. Unzip to access the main Saxon documentation in directory viewer_appJS.

The Saxon documentation supplied in this resources download runs as an interactive application
driven by SaxonJS in the browser (a copy of SaxonJS is included in the download). However, most
browsers do not allow SaxonJS to run from a local file system, so the documentation application may
not work directly. It is recommended that the HTTP protocol is used to access the resource files, so
it may be necessary to host this directory on a localhost web-server.
